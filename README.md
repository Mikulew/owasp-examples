## What is OWASP?

The **Open Web Application Security Project**, or **OWASP**, is an international non-profit organization dedicated to web application security. One of OWASP’s core principles is that all of their materials be freely available and easily accessible on their website, making it possible for anyone to improve their own web application security. The materials they offer include documentation, tools, videos, and forums. Perhaps their best-known project is the OWASP Top 10.

## What is the OWASP Top 10?

The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly-updated report outlining security concerns for web application security, **focusing on the 10 most critical risks**. The report is put together by a team of security experts from all over the world. OWASP refers to the Top 10 as an ‘awareness document’ and they recommend that all companies incorporate the report into their processes in order to minimize and/or mitigate security risks.

## Why OWASP Top 10 is important?

The OWASP Top 10 is important because **it gives organisations a priority over which risks to focus on and helps them understand, identify, mitigate, and fix vulnerabilities in their technology**. Each identified risk is prioritised according to prevalence, detectability, impact and exploitability.
